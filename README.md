PDFMarker
========================================================================

Minimalist wrapper library for [PDFMark][1], an extension to PostScript
first introduced in Adobe Distiller and today supported by almost every
modern PostScript interpreter.

Intended to be embedded in Troff documents targeting either PDF and PS,
offering a portable alternative to Groff's [`pdfmark.tmac`][2] macros.

Currently a work-in-progress.
